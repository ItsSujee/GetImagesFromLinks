# GetImagesFromLinks
Will download Imagenet.org images from the URLs

Copy and Paste the URLs in the string "deargodwhy"

Hit Enter and watch your source folder get filled with all the images from that URL dump.

Program will not crash, however if links are broken a blank image will be saved. Fix comming soon.
